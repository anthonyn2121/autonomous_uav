# Advanced Robotics 
## Aerial Vehicles 

A project based on three phases: 
- Writing a geometric nonlinear controller for stable quadrotor flight 
- Completing an A* grid search algorithm to find waypoints in a grid world 
- Incorporating the last 2 phases together and developing a trajectory controller to autonomously control a quadrotor to fly from a starting node to goal node 

# Outcome 
Here is the outcome of the project and you can see that the waypoints generated by the A* algorithm was filtered to create a sparse trajectory path. You can also see that the quadrotor followed a linear trajectory path, traveling from one waypoint to another.
